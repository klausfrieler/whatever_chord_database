# Whatever Chord Database
Raw data and exports of the Whatever Chord Database (Tillesen).

"Whatever" is a unique project by Swiss artist Peter Tillesen which brings the old song form of Quodlibets to pop music. Based on the observation that many pop/rock/folk songs rely on the same chord sequences, which means that they are basically compatible and allows thus quodlibets, the mixing of two pop songs. Quodlibets are an old folk song custom of singing two songs at the same time thus creating rich polyphony with simple means. In the case of well-known pop songs, the mixing of two songs at the same, preferably in a live setting with two musicians playing different songs based on the same chords in the same tempo, gives an interesting feeling of "mind split". 

In preparation for this project, a large corpus of pop songs chord sequences were collected in a simple Excel file and then algorithmically scanned for songs with compatible chords, which served then as a basis for the selection the actual songs that were performed as part of the "Whatever" project.

In this repository, we make these chord sequences freely available to the public.
