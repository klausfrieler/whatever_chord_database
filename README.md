# Whatever Chord Database
Raw data and exports of the Whatever Chord Database (Tillesen).

"Whatever" is a unique project by Swiss artist Peter Tillesen which brings the old singing practice of quodlibet to pop music. Based on the observation that many pop/rock/folk songs rely on the same chord sequences, which means that they are basically compatible and allow thus quodlibets, the idea of mixing  two or more pop songs at the same time was born. Quodlibet is the old folk song practce of singing two songs at the same time thus creating rich polyphony with simple means. In the case of well-known pop songs, a simular mixing of two songs at the same time, preferably in a live setting with  musicians, gives an interesting and uncanny feeling of a "mind split", and also reveals something about the pop song creative style. 

In preparation for this project, a large corpus of pop songs chord sequences were collected and algorithmically scanned for songs with compatible chords, which served then as a basis for the selection of the actual songs that were performed as part of the "Whatever" live show.

In this repository, we make these chord sequences freely available to the public.
